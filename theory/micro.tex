\section{Microscopic Description}
\label{sec:micro}

    The microscopic description of superconductivity is provided by the Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer (BCS) theory, which assumes that electrons near the Fermi surface form bound pairs of opposite momentum and spin, so called Cooper-pairs.
    
    At its heart, this pairing mechanism reflects a subtle interplay between electrons and phonons. When an electron moves through the metal, it slightly displaces the positively charged ions, creating a momentary region of excess positive charge. A second electron passing nearby can be attracted to this distortion, leading to an effective, though very weak attraction between the two. 
    
    This describes how electrons in a metal, which normally repel each other due to their negative charge, can nevertheless form bound pairs, known as Cooper-pairs, through an effective attraction mediated by vibrations of the crystal lattice. When many such pairs form simultaneously, they condense into a collective quantum state that carries electrical current without resistance.

    A key assumption of the BCS framework is that this effective interaction is weak compared to the electronic energy scales of the metal. This situation is referred to as the weak-coupling limit. In this regime, the attractive interaction acts only within a narrow energy shell around the Fermi surface, typically a few meV compared to Fermi energies of several eV. As a result, only a small fraction of electrons near the Fermi level participate in pairing, while the rest of the electronic structure remains essentially unaffected. Because the coupling is weak, the resulting energy gap and the critical temperature are small but can be predicted with high accuracy from the microscopic parameters.

    Among all known superconductors, aluminum is one of the best realizations of this weak-coupling scenario. Its superconducting transition temperature and energy gap are small, the electron-phonon interaction is weak and well understood, and its electronic structure is simple and free from strong correlations or magnetic effects. These features make aluminum behave almost exactly as predicted by the original BCS theory, allowing quantitative agreement between experiment and theory without the need for corrections or more advanced models.

    In summary, the weak-coupling limit describes a situation where the effective electron-phonon attraction is small compared to the Fermi energy, leading to a narrow pairing region and universal relationships between microscopic and macroscopic quantities. Aluminum exemplifies this regime and therefore serves as an archetype of a conventional BCS superconductor.

    The following subsections outline the key aspects of this microscopic picture. 
    First, the superconducting gap and its temperature dependency is introduced. This shows how the collective pairing strength evolves with thermal excitation. 
    Second, the electronic density of states is derived. The phenomenological Dynes parameter as measure of quasi-particle lifetime is introduced. The Fermi-Dirac distribution function and its temperature dependency is introduced as well.
    Third, the microscopic expressions for tunneling current are discussed, establishing the direct connection between these theoretical quantities and experimentally measurable \textit{I-V} and \textit{dI-dV} characteristics. 

    Finally, the extension to photon-assisted tunneling is presented, where an oscillating electromagnetic field enables quasi-particles to exchange discrete energy quanta during tunneling, thereby extending the static tunneling picture to the regime of externally driven superconducting transport.

    \subsection{Superconducting Gap}
    \label{subsec:micro:sc-gap}

        The weak-coupling approximation simplifies the theoretical treatment significantly. The normal-state density of states can be treated as constant, and the pairing interaction can be approximated as uniform within the relevant energy range. Many observable quantities therefore become universal, such as the ratio between the zero-temperature gap and the critical temperature, 
        \begin{equation}
            \Delta_0 \approx 1.764\, k_\mathrm{B} T_\mathrm{C}\,.
            \label{eq:micro:Delta0}
        \end{equation}

        The superconducting gap does not remain constant with temperature. At absolute zero, all available electrons near the Fermi surface form Cooper pairs, and the condensate is perfectly ordered. As the temperature rises, thermal excitations begin to break some of these pairs, leaving fewer electrons bound in the superconducting state. With fewer pairs contributing to the collective order, the overall pairing strength weakens, and the energy required to break a pair the gap $\Delta(T)$ gradually decreases.

        This reduction continues smoothly until the critical temperature $T_\mathrm{C}$ is reached. At that point, thermal energy becomes strong enough to completely disrupt the pairing correlations, and the superconducting state collapses, leading to $\Delta(T_\mathrm{C}) = 0$. The temperature dependence of the gap is a direct reflection of this balance between thermal disorder and the pairing interaction.

        \begin{wrapfigure}[12]{r}{0.4\textwidth}

            \label{fig:micro:gap_suppression}
        \end{wrapfigure} 
        In the BCS framework, $\Delta(T)$ follows a universal curve that results from solving the self-consistent gap equation, meaning the same functional form applies to all weak-coupling superconductors. 
        Solving the underlying integrals over the Fermi distribution in the microscopic theory numerically, results in the following Equation \ref{eq:DeltaT} or shown in Figure \ref{fig:micro:gap_suppression}.
        \begin{equation}
            \frac{\Delta(T)}{\Delta_0} \approx \tanh\left(1.74\,\sqrt{\frac{T_\mathrm{C}}{T}-1}\right)
            \label{eq:micro:DeltaT}
        \end{equation}

    \subsection{Density of States}
    \label{subsec:micro:dos}

        In the following, all energies are expressed relative to the Fermi energy $E_\mathrm{F}$, such that $E=0$ corresponds to the Fermi level around which superconducting correlations develop.
        
        In the normal state, the density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level varies only weakly with energy. Over the narrow range relevant to superconductivity this variation can be neglected, and the DOS can be treated as constant. The corresponding value at the Fermi energy is denoted
        \begin{equation}
            N_0 \equiv N_\mathrm{N}(E_\mathrm{F}) = \frac{1}{2\pi^2} \left(\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\right)^{3/2} \sqrt{E_\mathrm{F}}\,,
            \label{eq:micro:DOS-N0}
        \end{equation}
        representing the normal state DOS per spin at the Fermi level.

        When superconductivity sets in, pairing correlations reorganize this otherwise flat spectrum. A gap of width $2\Delta$ opens around $E_\mathrm{F}$ where single-particle excitations are absent in the ideal BCS limit, and the missing spectral weight is redistributed to the gap edges. These edges appear as sharp coherence peaks in the superconducting DOS, reflecting the high density of available quasi-particle states at the threshold for pair breaking. The resulting expression reads
        \begin{equation}
            \frac{N_\mathrm{S}(E)}{N_0} = 
                \left\{
                \begin{array}{@{}r@{\quad}l@{}}
                    0 & (|E| < \Delta)\\
                    \dfrac{|E|}{\sqrt{E^2-\Delta^2}} & (|E| \ge \Delta)
                \end{array}
                \right.\,.
            \label{eq:micro:DOS-BCS}
        \end{equation}
        Thus, in the ideal BCS limit the quasi-particle DOS is strictly zero within the energy gap and diverges at its edges, $E=\pm\Delta$. Increasing temperature alone does not cause a smearing of the density of states, but merely compresses its features in energy as the gap closes.

        However, real spectra are never perfectly sharp. A simple and very effective phenomenology is the broadening by Dynes parameter. It is implemented by the substitution $E\to E+\ima\Gamma$, while just considering the real part
        \begin{equation}
            \frac{N_\mathrm{S}(E)}{N_0} = \Re\!\left(\frac{E+\ima\Gamma}{\sqrt{(E+\ima\Gamma)^2-\Delta^2}}\right) \quad (|E| \ge \Delta)\,.
            \label{eq:micro:DOS-Dynes}
        \end{equation}
        Such broadening arises from finite quasi-particle lifetimes due to inelastic scattering, spatial inhomogeneity, pair breaking by magnetic impurities, or non-equilibrium effects, all of which smear the ideal BCS singularities. The DOS for a variaty of $\Gamma$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:micro:dos-fermi}. 
        \begin{figure}[t]
            \centering
            \import{theory/micro}{dos-fermi.pgf}
            \caption{Superconducting quasi-particle density of states $N_\mathrm{S}(E)$ and Fermi--Dirac distribution $f(E)$ for different Dynes parameters $\Gamma/\Delta_0$ and temperatures $T/T_\mathrm{C}$. Increasing $\Gamma$ broadens the coherence peaks of $N_\mathrm{S}(E)$, while increasing temperature smooths the Fermi edge. Parameters correspond to aluminum with $\Delta_0 = 180\,$\textmu eV and $T_\mathrm{C} = 1.18\,\mathrm{K}$, representative of a weak-coupling BCS superconductor.}
            \label{fig:micro:dos-fermi}
        \end{figure}

        Whereas the DOS specifies where states exist, the Fermi--Dirac distribution encodes how single-particle states are occupied at a given temperature and chemical potential. In the context of metals and conventional superconductors treated in this thesis, the chemical potential can be identified with the Fermi energy to very good approximation, $\mu\approx E_\mathrm{F}$, because thermal corrections are small on the scale of eV. So the energy scale is still relative to the Fermi energy, as before.

        In equilibrium the occupation probability of a state at energy $E$ is given by        
        \begin{equation}
            f(E) = \frac{1}{1+\exp\left(\frac{E}{k_\mathrm{B}T}\right)}\,.
            \label{eq:micro:fermidirac}
        \end{equation}        
        At zero temperature the distribution reduces to a sharp step $ \theta(E)$.

        However, all states below the Fermi function are filled and all states above are empty. At finite temperature the step is thermally broadened over an energy scale of order $k_\mathrm{B}T$, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:micro:dos-fermi}. 

    
    \subsection{Tunnel Current}
    \label{subsec:micro:tunnel-current}

        Tunneling spectroscopy offers a powerful means to probe the quasi-particle spectrum of superconductors in a controlled and conceptually simple way. The key idea is that if two electrodes are separated by a sufficiently thin insulating barrier, quasi-particles can quantum-mechanically tunnel between them, even though classically forbidden. 
        
        In the tunneling limit, the barrier is high and wide enough that the process is incoherent and each quasi-particle tunnels independently, so momentum conservation is effectively relaxed. 
        
        Under these conditions, the tunnel current from material $1$ to $2$ is given by
        \begin{equation}
            I_{1\to2}(V) \propto \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left(\frac{N_1(E)}{N_0} f_1(E) \right)\cdot \left(\frac{N_2(E+eV)}{N_0} \left(1-f_2(E+eV)\right)\right)\mathrm{d}E\,,
            \label{eq:micro:tunnel-1to2}
        \end{equation}
        where $eV$ is an externally applied voltage bias. The first part in Equation \ref{eq:micro:tunnel-1to2}, is given by the occupied states in material 1, the second part is given by the unoccupied states in material 2. However, in order to get the total tunnel current, one have to substract the tunnel current from material 2 to 1, resulting in
        \begin{equation}
            I(V) \propto \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{N_1(E)}{N_0} \frac{N_2(E+eV)}{N_0} \left(f_1(E)-f_2(E+eV)\right)\mathrm{d}E\,.
            \label{eq:micro:tunnel}
        \end{equation}
        
        The difference $f_1(E)-f_2(E+eV)$ accounts for the imbalance in occupation between the two electrodes induced by the applied bias voltage $eV$, ensuring that current flows only when filled states on one side overlap with empty states on the other. In this picture, the densities of states $N_1(E)$ and $N_2(E)$ define where electrons can tunnel, while the Fermi--Dirac distributions define which of those states are populated. The convolution of these terms thus directly connects the microscopic electronic structure to the measurable \textit{I-V} characteristics.

        In the case of an all normal conducting tunnel barrier, the current is given by
        \begin{equation}
            I_\mathrm{NN}(V) = \frac{G_\mathrm{N}}{e} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(E) - f(E + eV)\mathrm{d}E\,.
            \label{eq:micro:tunnel-nn}
        \end{equation}
        All geometric factors of the tunnel barrier, along with $N_0$ are collapsing into the normal conductance $G_\mathrm{N}$. 
        Given the two electrodes are in thermal equilibrium, effectively collapses the equation to Ohm's law
        \begin{equation}
            I_\mathrm{NN}(V) =  G_\mathrm{N}V\,.
            \label{eq:micro:ohms-law}
        \end{equation}

        In the case of a junction between a normal metal and a superconductor, the tunneling current is given by
        \begin{equation}
            I_\mathrm{NS}(V) = \frac{G_\mathrm{N}}{e} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{N_\mathrm{S}(E)}{N_0} \left[f(E) - f(E + eV)\right] \mathrm{d}E\,,
            \label{eq:micro:tunnel-ns}
        \end{equation}
        where $N_\mathrm{S}(E)$ denotes the superconducting quasi-particle density of states and $f(E)$ the Fermi--Dirac distribution. The differential conductance then follows as
        \begin{equation}
            \frac{\mathrm{d}I_\mathrm{NS}(V)}{\mathrm{d}V} = G_\mathrm{N} \left[ \frac{N_\mathrm{S}(E)}{N_0} \otimes -\frac{\partial f(E)}{\partial E}\right]_{E=eV}\,,
            \label{eq:micro:tunnel-ns-didv}
        \end{equation}
        showing that the measured \textit{dI-dV} corresponds to the superconducting density of states thermally broadened by the derivative of the Fermi function. This derivative is a symmetric, bell-shaped function whose width scales with temperature. As $T \to 0$, it approaches a delta function, and the convolution becomes negligible. At finite temperature, however, the \textit{dI-dV} smeares out, by the convolution. The energy resolution is then limited by thermal broadening, given approximately by $\Delta E_\text{th} \approx 3.5\,k_\mathrm{B}T$, which sets the smallest energy scale over which spectral features can be resolved.

        The expressions derived above not only describe the origin of tunneling currents but also provide a direct link to experimental observables. In scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), for example, a normal-metal tip above a superconducting surface forms an NIS junction. Measuring the \textit{I-V} or \textit{dI-dV} characteristics at sufficiently low temperature thus enables a direct mapping of the energy-resolved quasi-particle spectrum of the superconductor. 

        In case of all superconducting tunnel barrier, both electrodes contribute gapped densities of states. Their convolution, together with thermal and lifetime broadening, determines the observed shape of the \textit{I-V} and \textit{dI-dV} curves. 
        \begin{equation}
            I_\mathrm{SS}(V) = \frac{G_\mathrm{N}}{e}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{N_\mathrm{S}(E)}{N_0} \cdot \frac{N_\mathrm{S}(E+eV)}{N_0} \cdot \left[f(E) - f(E + eV)\right] \mathrm{d}E
            \label{eq:micro:tunnel-ss}
        \end{equation}
        Importantly, temperature $T$ and Dynes broadening $\Gamma$ influence the spectra in distinct ways. Finite temperature broadens the Fermi edges via the Fermi--Dirac distribution, while $\Gamma$ introduces intrinsic smearing of the quasi-particle DOS itself. By fitting measured \textit{I-V} or \textit{dI-dV} data, with both parameters as variables, one can disentangle thermal effects from genuine lifetime or inelastic processes.

        These interpretations form the foundation of tunneling spectroscopy as a quantitative probe of superconductivity, allowing the extraction of $\Delta_0$, $T$, and $\Gamma$ from experimental data with high accuracy.

    \subsection{Photon-Assisted Tunneling}
    \label{subsec:micro:pat}

        While the previous section described static tunneling, the application of a time-dependent voltage enables quasi-particles to exchange discrete energy quanta with an external electromagnetic field, giving rise to photon-assisted tunneling (PAT).

        In practice, this effect is typically studied using electromagnetic radiation in the microwave range, since photon energies $h\nu$ in this regime are comparable to the superconducting energy gap $\Delta_0$ and can therefore induce measurable sidebands without breaking the Cooper pairs.

        Possible energies are given by
        \begin{equation}
            E_n = n h\nu\quad (n \in \mathbb{Z})\,,
            \label{eq:micro:pat-En}
        \end{equation}
        where each photon carries an energy $h\nu$ and $n$ is the number of photons absorbed ($n>0$) or emitted ($n<0$). As a result, additional tunneling channels open at these energies, producing characteristic replicas of the coherence peaks in \textit{dI-dV}.

        The Tien--Gordon model provides a simple and intuitive framework to describe this effect. It assumes that the junction operates in the tunneling limit, as described before in Section~\ref{subsec:micro:tunnel-current}. The electromagnetic field is treated classically and is represented by a spatially uniform, time-dependent voltage across the junction,
        \begin{equation}
            V(t) = V_0 + A \cos (2\pi\,\nu t)\,.
            \label{eq:micro:pat-V(t)}
        \end{equation}
        Here $V_0$ is the applied voltage bias, $A$ the amplitude, and $\nu$ the frequency of the microwave field across the junction. The field is assumed to remain unaltered by the tunneling current, meaning no cavity or backaction effects, and the drive is weak enough not to heat the electrodes, allowing both to stay in thermal equilibrium.

        In a gauge where the entire voltage drop appears as a scalar potential, a tunneling electron acquires a time-dependent factor in its wavefunction,
        \begin{equation}
            \psi(t) \propto \exp\!\left(-\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_0^t e V(t')\, dt' \right)\,.
            \label{eq:micro:pat-wf0}
        \end{equation}

        For the harmonic drive of Eq.~\eqref{eq:micro:pat-V(t)}, the integral can be solved by
        \begin{equation}
            \int_0^t e V(t')\, dt' = eV_0 t + \frac{eA}{2\pi\nu}\sin(2\pi\nu t)\,.
            \label{eq:micro:pat-int}
        \end{equation}
        This equantion is further solved by the Jacobi--Anger identity,
        \begin{equation}
            \exp\left(i\alpha \sin(2\pi\nu t)\right) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} J_n(\alpha)\, \exp\left(i n 2\pi\nu t\right)\,,
        \end{equation}
        where $\alpha = eA/h\nu$ denotes the dimensionless modulation strength and $J_n(\alpha)$ is the $n$-th Bessel function of first kind.

        The wavefunction becomes then
        \begin{equation}
            \psi(t) \propto \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} J_n(\alpha)\, \exp\!\left( -\frac{i}{\hbar}(eV_0 - n h\nu)\, t  \right)\,,
            \label{eq:micro:pat-wf}
        \end{equation}
        revealing that an electronic state subjected to an AC voltage becomes a superposition of components at energies shifted by $n h\nu$. Each component corresponds to the absorption ($n>0$) or emission ($n<0$)
        of $|n|$ photons. Because tunneling probabilities are proportional to the squared amplitude, these channels carry weights $J_n^2(\alpha)$.

        This perspective permits a particularly transparent interpretation in terms of an effective, photon-dressed density of states. Each shifted wavefunction component contributes a copy of the local DOS displaced by $n h\nu$. The resulting effective DOS is
        \begin{equation}
            N_\mathrm{PAT}(E) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} J_n^2(\alpha)\, N(E + n h\nu)\,,
            \label{eq:micro:pat-dos}
        \end{equation}
        which replaces $N(E)$ in the tunneling expression. The PAT-modified current therefore becomes a weighted sum of shifted copies of the static \textit{I-V} curve.

        Putting these contributions together leads to the Tien--Gordon formula,
        \begin{equation}
            I(V_0) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} J_n^2\!\left( \frac{eA}{h\nu}\right) \cdot I_0\!\left(V_0 - \frac{n h\nu}{e}\right)\,.
            \label{eq:micro:pat-tien-gordon}
        \end{equation}
        which expresses the total current as the incoherent sum of all photon-assisted tunneling channels.  Each channel contributes a copy of the static \textit{I-V} curve shifted by $n h\nu/e$ and weighted by the probability $J_n^2(\alpha)$ for absorbing or emitting $n$ photons, producing the characteristic sideband structure observed in experiment.

        The same relation also holds for the differential conductance, meaning that the photon-assisted replicas $\mathrm{d}I_0(V_0)/\mathrm{d}V$ appear identically as in the current, providing a direct experimental link to the superconducting density of states.

        In practice, the amplitude $A$ can be determined experimentally by comparing the relative heights of the sidebands with the expected Bessel function weights. The spacing $h\nu$ between sidebands provides a direct and robust calibration of the frequency. Photon-assisted tunneling thus offers a straightforward semiclassical description of how an oscillating field modifies quasi-particle transport, serving as a bridge between static tunneling spectroscopy and driven quantum dynamics.
