This part sets up everything that appears in multiple regimes — the shared vocabulary of your thesis.
Keep it compact and conceptual; defer all regime-specific derivations to their chapters.

Include:
	•	BCS and quasiparticles — gap, density of states, coherence factors, Dynes parameter.
	•	Quasiparticle tunneling in an S–I–S junction (basic Tien–Gordon idea, but not the full application).
	•	Andreev reflection and multiple Andreev reflection (MAR) — introduce the concept of transmission channels and the Landauer picture for superconductors.
	•	Josephson effect basics — DC and AC Josephson relations, phase coherence.
	•	Tien–Gordon formalism — general concept of photon-assisted tunneling under microwaves.
	•	Measurement principles — microwave irradiation, lock-in technique, MCBJ basics (high-level).

Goal: after this chapter, the reader understands your “theoretical toolkit”.
