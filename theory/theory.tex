\chapter{Superconducting Transport}
\label{ch:superconducting-transport}
%=========================================================

    Superconductivity was first discovered by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes in 1911, when he observed that the electrical resistance of mercury dropped abruptly to zero upon cooling below 4.2\,K. This remarkable phenomenon revealed a new quantum state of matter, characterized by the complete absence of electrical resistance and the expulsion of magnetic fields, known as the Meissner--Ochsenfeld effect, discovered in 1933. These two defining properties, perfect conductivity and perfect diamagnetism, set superconductors apart from ordinary metals and established a foundation for both fundamental research and technological applications. \cite{onnes_further_1991, meissner_neuer_1933}

    At its core, superconductivity arises from the collective behavior of electrons, which form bound pairs and condense into a macroscopic quantum state described by a single coherent wavefunction. The subsequent sections build a comprehensive theoretical picture of this phenomenon from complementary perspectives.

    The first section introduces the microscopic Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer theory from 1957. This theory explains how electrons near the Fermi surface pair via phonon mediated attraction and how this pairing gives rise to an energy gap and a characteristic quasi-particle density of states. This microscopic framework establishes the foundation for understanding tunneling spectroscopy and photon-assisted transport. 

    Followed by the second section introducing the macroscopic Ginzburg--Landau theory from 1950. The collective phase of the superconducting condensate determines the behavior of weak links. Here, phase coherence manifests in phenomena such as the DC and AC Josephson effects, Shapiro steps, and the influence of dissipation and capacitance captured by the RCSJ model. 

    Next, the mesoscopic description section bridges microscopic and macroscopic transport through the theory of Andreev and multiple Andreev reflections. These processes describe how charge is transferred through highly transparent superconducting contacts and how the resulting \textit{I-V} characteristics encode the microscopic transmission properties of the junction, forming the quantitative link between experiment and theory.

    Penultimately, the stochastic description considers phase fluctuations in dissipative environments. Fundamentally using P(E)-Theory.

    \subsubsection*{Aluminum as a Model BCS Superconductor}

        Throughout this chapter, aluminum serves as the representative weak-coupling BCS superconductor. It possesses a nearly free-electron-like band structure, an isotropic s-wave energy gap, and a well-understood phonon-mediated pairing mechanism. The zero-temperature gap and critical temperature are to good approximation
        \begin{equation}
            \Delta_0 \approx 180\,\mu\mathrm{eV}\,,\qquad
            T_\mathrm{C} \approx 1.2\,\mathrm{K}\,.
            \label{eq:aluminum}
        \end{equation}
        Its long coherence length of order 1-2\,\textmu m, high electronic purity, and weak spin--orbit scattering make aluminum ideally suited for tunneling spectroscopy and mesoscopic superconducting transport. The comparatively small gap places typical microwave frequencies well below the pair-breaking threshold, enabling controlled photon-assisted processes without degrading superconductivity\footnote{The pair-breaking frequency of aluminium is given by $\nu\mathrm{pb}=2\Delta_0/h\approx 100\,\mathrm{GHz}$.}. Moreover, aluminum naturally forms reproducible aluminum-oxide tunnel barriers and reliably yields stable atomic contacts. It therefore provides a consistent and unified material platform for all transport phenomena discussed in this chapter.

    \subsubsection*{Global Microwave Drive Model}
    
        Many of the transport phenomena discussed in this chapter involve the presence of a time-dependent electromagnetic drive. To avoid repeated introductions of the same setup, we summarize here the general assumptions that apply to all subsequent descriptions. The drive is treated as a classical, externally imposed field. No cavity modes or backaction of the junction onto the field are considered. The entire voltage drop is assumed to occur across the junction, a convenient gauge choice. In consequence, the electromagnetic field enters only through the scalar potential in the tunneling Hamiltonian or via the Josephson phase evolution. The drive amplitude is taken to be small enough not to heat the electrodes, allowing both to remain in local thermal equilibrium with Fermi--Dirac distributions. Finally, the drive frequencies are chosen such that photon energy is way smaller than the pair-breaking energy, ensuring that Cooper pairs remain intact while the phase dynamics are driven coherently. In practice, frequencies in the microwave range up to about 20\,GHz are used.

        The spatially uniform microwave field is then given by 
        \begin{equation}
            V(t) = V_0 + A \cos (2\pi\nu t)\,,
            \label{eq:microwave}
        \end{equation}
        with a static component $V_0$, drive amplitude $A$, and frequency $\nu$. 
        
        The charge relevant for the electromagnetic phase is $q = m e$ with $m\in\{1,\,2,\,3,\,\dots\}$. For quasi-particles $m=1$, for Cooper-pair and single Andreev processes $m=2$, and for higher-order multiple Andreev reflections the effective transferred charge is $m>2$. However, the accumulated potential, determines the relevant electromagnetic phase factor
        \begin{align}
            \exp\!\left(-\ima\phi(t)\right) &= \exp\!\left( - \frac{\ima}{\hbar} \int_0^t q V(t')\, dt' \right) \\
            &= \!\exp\left(-\ima \phi_0(t)\right)\exp\!\left(\ima \alpha \sin(2\pi\nu t) \right)\,.
        \end{align}
        where $\alpha=qA/h\nu$ denotes the dimensionless modulation strength and $\phi_0(t) = q V_0 t / \hbar$ is the phase difference generated by the static drive.

        The phase factor is conveniently expanded using the Jacobi--Anger identity,
        \begin{equation}
            \exp\!\left(\ima\alpha \sin(2\pi\nu t)\right) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} J_n(\alpha)\,
            \exp\!\left(\ima n\ 2\pi\nu t\right)\,
            \label{eq:microwave:jacobi-anger}
        \end{equation}
        where $J_n(\alpha)$ is the $n$-th Bessel function of the first kind. This harmonic decomposition will be used repeatedly in this chapter.
