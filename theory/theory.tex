\chapter{Superconducting Transport}
\label{ch:superconducting-transport}
%=========================================================

    Superconductivity was first observed by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes in 1911, when the electrical resistance of mercury vanished abruptly upon cooling below 4.2\,K. Shortly thereafter, the Meissner--Ochsenfeld effect revealed that superconductors also expel magnetic fields, establishing the two defining macroscopic properties of this quantum state of matter: perfect conductivity and perfect diamagnetism. \cite{onnes_further_1991, meissner_neuer_1933}

    At its core, superconductivity originates from an effective attraction between electrons near the Fermi surface. When an electron moves through the metal, it slightly distorts the ion lattice, creating a transient region of enhanced positive charge. A second electron can be attracted to this distortion, resulting in a very weak but cooperative pairing mechanism mediated by lattice vibrations (phonons). Despite the underlying Coulomb repulsion, this mechanism allows pairs of electrons with opposite momentum and spin to form Cooper-pairs. When many such pairs form simultaneously, they condense into a coherent macroscopic quantum state capable of carrying electrical current without resistance.

    The remainder of this chapter develops a comprehensive theoretical framework for superconducting transport from four complementary viewpoints. These perspectives differ in the degrees of freedom they emphasize quasi-particles, phase dynamics, transparency channels, and environmental fluctuations. Together form a consistent and unified picture of the phenomena observed in experiment.

    The first part introduces the microscopic Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer theory. It describes how electrons near the Fermi surface pair in the weak-coupling limit, how this pairing leads to an energy gap and a characteristic quasi-particle density of states, and how these quantities manifest in tunneling spectroscopy and photon-assisted transport.

    The second part presents the macroscopic phase-based description of superconducting weak links. Since the order-parameter amplitude is nearly constant in the tunneling limit, the phase becomes the sole dynamical variable controlling coherent Cooper-pair transport. This leads directly to the Josephson relations, the microwave-induced Shapiro steps, and the classical phase dynamics described by the RCSJ model, which incorporates dissipation and capacitance and forms the basis for interpreting real \textit{I--V} characteristics.

    The third part provides the mesoscopic description, which connects microscopic quasi-particle physics with macroscopic phase coherence. Here, Andreev reflection and multiple Andreev reflections govern charge transport in highly transparent contacts, and the resulting \textit{I--V} characteristics encode the microscopic transmission properties of the junction.

    Finally, the stochastic description accounts for phase fluctuations in dissipative electromagnetic environments through \textit{P(E)}-theory. This framework captures how the impedance of the surrounding circuitry affects phase coherence, energy exchange, and the overall \textit{I--V} characteristics.

    Before turning to the detailed microscopic, macroscopic, mesoscopic, and stochastic descriptions, Sec.~\ref{sec:basics} collects the basic concepts and global definitions used throughout this chapter. It introduces the quasiparticle description and Drude picture of normal-state transport, the mesoscopic transport regimes and their formulation in terms of transmission channels, the properties of aluminum as the central material platform, and the generic microwave drive model employed in all driven-transport scenarios.
