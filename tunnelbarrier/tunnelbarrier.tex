\chapter{Tunnel-barrier junctions}

Chapter 3: Tunnel-barrier junctions (Al AlOx Al)

Short theory section:
	-	\section{Dynes DOS, tunneling current} formula (BCS + Dynes broadening).
	-	\section{Tien–Gordon photon-assisted tunneling}.
	-	Suppression of $I_c$ under irradiation (qualitative Josephson discussion).

Results/discussion:
	-	I–V curves under irradiation → Tien-Gordon fits → extraction of $T_\mathrm{e}$.
	-	\section{Suppression by temperature \& magnetic field}.
	-	\section{Asymmetric IV behavior near resonance} (speculative discussion).

Purpose: demonstrate that you can quantitatively explain behavior in the low-transmission limit.
