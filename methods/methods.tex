\chapter{Experimental Methods} 
\label{chapter:experimental-methods}

    In this chapter, I will describe the experimental methods used in this work.

    First, I will discuss the sample preparation process. Although the fabrication of break junctions is well-established within the group, significant changes have been made to the design. These improvements have led to the development of a new protocol, enhancing the overall quality and stability of the samples.

    The second section covers the physical setup. Considerable time was invested in making modifications, performing routine maintenance, and addressing issues with aging components. In particular, the cabling for direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) measurements underwent significant upgrades to improve reliability and performance.

    In the third section, I will describe the electronics used. This includes an overview of the general setup and a detailed discussion of the newly implemented measurement program. Additional technical details about the Python implementation can be found in the appendix. Finally, I will present the measurement and evaluation protocols, including the data processing methods.
