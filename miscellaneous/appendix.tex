Option 1 — No explicit “Miscellaneous” chapter

This is the cleanest for most theses.
You integrate every bit of content under one of the main scientific chapters or the appendices.
Use appendices for anything that is:
	•	technical but not central (calibration curves, fitting scripts, additional I–V traces),
	•	background or validation measurements (e.g., temperature calibration, microwave attenuation tests).

Then the main text stays focused and logical.

🔹 Option 2 — A short “Miscellaneous Results” chapter

If you have several small, independent results that don’t warrant full chapters — for example:
	•	supplementary microwave experiments (different frequencies, powers),
	•	tests on non-Al samples,
	•	noise measurements,
	•	comparisons between fitting methods,

— then you can group them as a compact “Additional Experiments and Analysis” or “Miscellaneous” chapter near the end.

Suggested layout:

Chapter 6 — Additional Experiments and Analyses

6.1 Temperature and Magnetic-Field Dependence
Briefly show confirmation that the devices behave as expected (e.g. gap suppression).

6.2 Frequency-Dependent Effects
Show the asymmetric I–V features and discuss possible causes (resonances, heating, impedance mismatch).

6.3 Auxiliary Measurements and Calibrations
Include details such as microwave coupling, line attenuation, or base-temperature determination.

Keep this concise — it shouldn’t look like an afterthought but rather a supporting evidence collection.

⸻

🔹 Option 3 — Miscellaneous Appendices

If your “miscellaneous” content is highly technical or data-heavy:
	•	Appendix A: Detailed fitting procedure for Tien–Gordon model
	•	Appendix B: Raw I–V data and error estimation
	•	Appendix C: Microwave calibration
	•	Appendix D: Temperature extraction via Dynes fits

That keeps your main story crisp but documents everything transparently.

⸻

🔹 Recommendation for you

Given your description so far, I’d suggest:
	•	No “Miscellaneous” chapter in the main thesis body.
	•	Instead, include a short “Additional Experiments” section at the end of your High-Transmission chapter (for asymmetric I–Vs etc.),
	•	and move purely technical or validation content to appendices.

That way, everything still feels intentional and thematically grouped.
