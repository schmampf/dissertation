The technique employs masks offset from the substrate and oblique angle thin-film deposition. It provides a simple means of making small-area Josephson junctions and varying-thickness superconducting bridges and is suitable for the inclusion of these devices in circuits. The examples we show emphasize such applications in superconductivity; however, the technique may find uses in other fields as well.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.cond-mat/9901308},
	abstract = {Three types of metallic nanostructures comprising niobium were investigated experimentally; in all three types, electric transport at very low temperatures was governed by Coulomb blockade effects. 1. Thin film strips of niobium could be tuned into resistor strips by an electrochemical anodisation process, using microfabricated masks and in situ resistance monitoring. These resistors showed a transition from superconducting to insulating behaviour with increasing sheet resistance, occurring at a value approximately equal to the quantum resistance for Cooper pairs, h/(4e{\textasciicircum}2). 2. Combining the anodisation technique with lateral size minimisation by shadow evaporation, devices in a single electron transistor-like configuration with two weak links and a small island between these were made. Direct evidence for the Coulomb blockade in the anodisation thinned niobium films was found when the transport characteristics could be modulated periodically by sweeping the voltage applied to a gate electrode placed on top of the structure. 3. Conventional single electron transistors with Al base electrodes, {AlO}\_x barriers formed in situ by oxidation, and Nb top electrodes were made by angular evaporation. The output current noise of such a transistor was measured as a function of bias voltage, gate voltage, and temperature. The low frequency noise was found to be dominated by charge input noise. The dependence of the noise on the bias voltage is consistent with self-heating of the transistor activating the noise sources.},

	abstract = {In superconducting quantum point contacts, multiple Andreev reflection ({MAR}), which describes the coherent transport of m quasiparticles each carrying an electron charge with m ≥ 3, sets in at voltage thresholds {eV} = 2 /m. In singleelectron transistors, Coulomb blockade, however, suppresses the current at low voltage. The required voltage for charge transport increases with the square of the effective charge {eV} ∝ (me)2. Thus, studying the charge transport in all-superconducting singleelectron transistors ({SSETs}) sets these two phenomena into competition. In this article, we present the fabrication as well as a measurement scheme and transport data for a {SSET} with one junction in which the transmission and thereby the {MAR} contributions can be continuously tuned. All regimes from weak to strong coupling are addressed. We extend the Orthodox theory by incorporating {MAR} processes to describe the observed data qualitatively. We detect a new transport process the nature of which is unclear at present. Furthermore, we observe a renormalization of the charging energy when approaching the strong coupling regime.},

In particular, the Tien-Gordon approach and its extensions predict that the sideband spacing in bias voltage is a direct fingerprint of the number of electrons transferred in a single tunneling event. Here, we analyze photon-assisted tunneling into subgap states in superconductors in the limit of small temperatures and bias voltages where tunneling is dominated by resonant Andreev processes and does not conform to the predictions of simple Tien-Gordon theory. Our analysis is based on a systematic Keldysh calculation of the subgap conductance and provides a detailed analytical understanding of photon-assisted tunneling into subgap states, in excellent agreement with a recent experiment. We focus on tunneling from superconducting electrodes and into Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states associated with magnetic impurities or adatoms, but we also explicitly extend our results to include normal-metal electrodes or other types of subgap states in superconductors. In particular, we argue that photon-assisted Andreev reflections provide a high-accuracy method to measure small but nonzero energies of subgap states which can be important for distinguishing conventional subgap states from Majorana bound states.},

A unifying theory of this effect emerged in the 90's within the framework of mesoscopic physics. Based on two cornerstone concepts, conduction channels and Andreev reflection, it predicts the current-phase relation for the most basic weak-link: a single conduction channel of arbitrary transmission. This thesis illustrates this mesoscopic point of view with experiments on superconducting atomic size contacts. In particular, we have focused on the supercurrent peak around zero voltage, put into evidence the ac Josephson currents in a contact under constant bias voltage (Shapiro resonances and photon assisted multiple Andreev reflections), and performed direct measurements of the current-phase relation.

	abstract = {Fabrication of structures at the atomic scale is now possible using state-of-the-art techniques for manipulating individual atoms1, and it may become possible to design electrical circuits atom by atom. A prerequisite for successful design is a knowledge of the relationship between the macroscopic electrical characteristics of such circuits and the quantum properties of the individual atoms used as building blocks. As a first step, we show here that the chemical valence determines the conduction properties of the simplest imaginable circuit—a one-atom contact between two metallic banks. The extended quantum states that carry the current from one bank to the other necessarily proceed through the valence orbitals of the constriction atom. It thus seems reasonable to conjecture that the number of current-carrying modes (or ‘channels’) of a one-atom contact is determined by the number of available valence orbitals, and so should strongly differ for metallic elements in different series of the periodic table. We have tested this conjecture using scanning tunnelling microscopy and mechanically controllable break-junction techniques2,3 to obtain atomic-size constrictions for four different metallic elements (Pb, Al, Nb and Au), covering a broad range of valences and orbital structures. Our results demonstrate unambiguously a direct link between valence orbitals and the number of conduction channels in one-atom contacts.},

This effect presents an early example of a driven–dissipative quantum phenomenon and is presently utilized in primary voltage standards. Shapiro steps have also become one of the standard tools to probe junctions made in a variety of novel materials. Here we study Shapiro steps in a widely tunable graphene-based Josephson junction in which the high-frequency dynamics is determined by the on-chip environment. We investigate the variety of patterns that can be obtained in this well-understood system depending on the carrier density, temperature, {RF} frequency, and magnetic field. Although the patterns of Shapiro steps can change drastically when just one parameter is varied, the overall trends can be understood and the behaviors straightforwardly simulated, showing some key differences from the conventional {RCSJ} model. The resulting understanding may help interpret similar measurements in more complex materials.},

Understanding the origin of the energy spectrum of such hybrids is therefore a crucial goal. Here, we study Josephson junctions defined by shadow epitaxy on {InAsSb}/Al nanowires. The devices exhibit gate-tunable supercurrents at low temperatures and multiple Andreev reflections ({MARs}) at finite voltage bias. Under microwave irradiation, photon-assisted tunneling ({PAT}) of {MARs} produces characteristic oscillating sidebands at quantized energies, which depend on {MAR} order, n, in agreement with a recently suggested modification of the classical Tien–Gordon equation. The scaling of the quantized energy spacings with microwave frequency provides independent confirmation of the effective charge, ne, transferred by the nth-order tunneling process. The measurements suggest {PAT} as a powerful method for assigning the origin of low-energy spectral features in hybrid Josephson devices.},

While a sinusoidal {CPR} is expected for conventional junctions with insulating weak links, devices made from some exotic materials may give rise to unconventional {CPRs} and unusual Josephson effects. In this work, we present such a case: we investigate the proximity-induced superconductivity in {SnTe} nanowires by incorporating them as weak links in {JJs} and observe a deviation from the standard {CPR}. We report on indications of an unexpected breaking of time-reversal symmetry in these devices, detailing the unconventional characteristics that reveal this behavior. These include an asymmetric critical current in the {DC} Josephson effect, a prominent second harmonic in the {AC} Josephson effect, and a magnetic diffraction pattern with a minimum in critical current at zero magnetic field. The analysis examines how multiband effects and the experimentally visualized ferroelectric domain walls give rise to this behavior, giving insight into the Josephson effect in materials that possess ferroelectricity and/or multiband superconductivity.},

The properties of these junctions are characterized and compared to those fabricated with weak links of {PbTe}, a similar material yet topologically trivial. Most striking is the difference in the ac Josephson effect: junctions made with Pb0.5⁢Sn0.5⁢Te exhibit a rich subharmonic structure consistent with a skewed current-phase relation. This structure is absent in junctions fabricated from {PbTe}. A discussion is given on the origin of this effect as an indication of novel behavior arising from the topologically nontrivial surface state.},

	abstract = {Experiments on both point-contact junctions (Nb-Nb) and on small area thin-film tunnel junctions (S⁢n −𝑂 −S⁢n) show that applied 4-mm radiation produces satellites associated with "subharmonic" gap structure as well as the familiar microwave-assisted tunneling structure associated with the superconducting energy gap itself. The location in voltage of all these structures is given by 𝑒⁢𝑉 =(2⁢𝛥±nh⁢𝜈)𝑚, where 2⁢𝛥 is the superconducting energy gap, 𝜈 is the applied frequency, ℎ is Planck's constant, 𝑒 is the magnitude of the electronic charge, 𝑉 is the dc voltage drop across the junction, and 𝑚 and 𝑛 are integers: 𝑚 =1,2,3,… and 𝑛 =0,1,2,…. The power dependence of the satellite structure and the microwave-assisted tunneling structure is consistent for all junctions tested with the expression 𝐽2𝑛⁡(𝑚⁢𝑒⁢𝑉rfℎ⁡𝜈), where 𝐽𝑛⁡(𝑥) is the ordinary Bessel function of order 𝑛, 𝑉rf is the amplitude of the induced microwave voltage drop accross the junction, and the other quantities are as defined above. A distinction between the explanations—multiparticle tunneling and nonlinear self-coupling—of the subharmonic gap structure cannot, however, be made on the basis of the observed power dependence. Hence other properties such as relative amplitude and line shape are considered and it is concluded that self-coupling mechanisms seem able to account for all the observations, whereas multiparticle tunneling may be discarded as the sole explanation of the structure.},

	abstract = {A microscopic theory of the transport properties of quantum point contacts giving a unified description of the normal conductor-superconductor (N-S) and superconductor-superconductor (S-S) cases is presented. It is based on a model Hamiltonian describing charge transfer processes in the contact region and makes use of nonequilibrium Green function techniques for the calculation of the relevant quantities. It is explicitly shown that when calculations are performed up to infinite order in the coupling between the electrodes, the theory contains all known results predicted by the more usual scattering approach for N-S and S-S contacts. For the latter we introduce a specific formulation for dealing with the nonstationary transport properties. An efficient algorithm is developed for obtaining the dc and ac current components, which allows a detailed analysis of the different current-voltage characteristics for all range of parameters. We finally address the less understood small bias limit, for which some analytical results can be obtained within the present formalism. It is shown that four different physical regimes can be reached in this limit depending on the values of the inelastic scattering rate and the contact transmission. The behavior of the system in these regimes is discussed together with the conditions for their experimental observability. © 1996 The American Physical Society.},

When Louis Cailletet on December 2nd, 1877, realized a major step in terms of the production of low temperatures, namely the ?rst liquefaction of oxygen, he could hardly imagine the wealth of exciting physical phenomena that would bediscoveredinthis?eld. Despitetheanticipation fromeverydayexperience, which generally equates cold with discomfort and sti?ening, condensed m- ter at low temperatures reveals a wide array of fascinating properties. As the mostprominentexamplesletusmentionsuper?uidityandsuperconductivity, whose attraction is undiminished since their discovery. With every step - wards lower temperatures numerous new insights have resulted, which make the traditional subject of low-temperature physics an attractive and modern research topic. The present book is based on material from lectures that both authors have given several times at the universities of Heidelberg, Bayreuth and Konstanz. It is focused on the discussion of physical phenomena that become most apparent at low temperatures. The book is mainly aimed at students, and provides a compact and comprehensible introduction to various topics of low-temperature physics. Selection and emphasis of the material is subj- tive and certainly re?ects our personal preferences. However, we have tried to give room for as wide a spectrum of topics as possible. The contents are organized in three parts, entitled quantum ?uids, solids at low temperatures and principles of refrigeration and thermometry.},

	abstract = {The field of single charge tunneling comprises of phenomena where the tunneling of a microscopic charge, usually carried by an electron or a Cooper pair, leads to macro scopically observable effects. The first conference entirely devoted to this new field was the {NATO} Advanced Study Institute on Single Charge Tunneling held in Les Hauches, France, March 5-15, 1991. This book contains a series of tutorial articles based on lectures presented at the meeting. It was intended to provide both an introduction for nonexperts and a valuable reference summarizing the state of the art of single charge tun neling. A complementary publication with contributions by participants of the {NATO} Advanced Study Institute is the Special Issue on Single Charge Tunneling of Zeitschrift für Physik B, Vol. 85, pp. 317-468 (1991 ). That issue with original papers provides a snapshot af the leading edge of current research in the field. The success of the meeting and the publicatian of this volume was made possible through the generaus support af the {NATO} Scientific A:ffairs Division, Brussels, Belgium. The Centre de Physique des Hauches has provided a superbly situated conference site and took care af many lacal arrangements. Both far the preparation of the conference and the handling af some manuscripts the suppart af the Centre d 'Etudes de Saclay was essential.

	abstract = {One of the greatest recent achievements in condensed matter physics is the discovery of a new class of materials, topological insulators ({TIs}), whose bulk is insulating, while the edges conduct current in a quasi-ideal way. In particular, the 1D edges of 2D {TIs} realize the quantum spin Hall state, where current is carried without dissipation by two counter-propagating ballistic edge states, with spin orientation locked to the propagation direction (a helical edge state). This opens up a wide range of possibilities, from dissipation-free charge and spin transport at room temperature, to new avenues for quantum computing. The classification of {TIs} has recently been extended, with the discovery of second-order topological insulators ({SOTIs}), which are three-dimensional crystals whose bulk and surfaces are insulating, but which exhibit onedimensional conductive (topologically protected) helical “hinge” states. Experimentally, only a few materials have been identified as {SOTIs}, such as bismuth and {WTe}2. However, most {SOTIs} also have conductive surfaces or bulk, so topological states coexist with non-topological ones. Recently, other materials have been proposed as belonging to this new family of topological insulators. Among them, Bi4Br4 is particularly interesting because its bulk and surfaces are truly insulating.},

Photon-assisted tunnelling combined with the venerable Tien–Gordon model has long been a powerful tool to identify tunnelling processes between superconductors. Here, we probe superconducting tunnel junctions including an impurity-induced Yu–Shiba–Rusinov ({YSR}) state by exposing a scanning tunnelling microscope with a superconducting tip to microwave radiation. We find that a simple Tien–Gordon description describes tunnelling of single electrons and Cooper pairs into the bare substrate, but breaks down for tunnelling via {YSR} states by resonant Andreev reflections. We develop an improved theoretical description that is in excellent agreement with the data. Our results establish photon-assisted tunnelling as a powerful tool to analyse tunnelling processes at the atomic scale, which should be particularly informative for unconventional and topological superconductors.},

	abstract = {A theory of superconductivity is presented, based on the fact that the interaction between electrons resulting from virtual exchange of phonons is attractive when the energy difference between the electrons states involved is less than the phonon energy, ℏ⁢𝜔. It is favorable to form a superconducting phase when this attractive interaction dominates the repulsive screened Coulomb interaction. The normal phase is described by the Bloch individual-particle model. The ground state of a superconductor, formed from a linear combination of normal state configurations in which electrons are virtually excited in pairs of opposite spin and momentum, is lower in energy than the normal state by amount proportional to an average (ℏ⁢𝜔)2, consistent with the isotope effect. A mutually orthogonal set of excited states in one-to-one correspondence with those of the normal phase is obtained by specifying occupation of certain Bloch states and by using the rest to form a linear combination of virtual pair configurations. The theory yields a second-order phase transition and a Meissner effect in the form suggested by Pippard. Calculated values of specific heats and penetration depths and their temperature variation are in good agreement with experiment. There is an energy gap for individual-particle excitations which decreases from about 3.5⁢𝑘⁢𝑇𝑐 at 𝑇 =0°K to zero at 𝑇𝑐. Tables of matrix elements of single-particle operators between the excited-state superconducting wave functions, useful for perturbation expansions and calculations of transition probabilities, are given.},

	abstract = {If a small potential difference is applied between two metals separated by a thin insulating film, a current will flow due to the quantum mechanical tunnel effect. For both metals in the normal state the current-voltage characteristic is linear, for one of the metals in the superconducting state the current voltage characteristic becomes nonlinear, and for both metals in the superconductive state even a negative-resistance region is obtained. From these changes in the current voltage characteristics, the change in the electron density of states when a metal goes from its normal to its superconductive state can be inferred. By using this technique we have found the energy gap in metal films 1000-3000 A thick at 1°K to be 2⁢𝜀Pb =(2.68 ±0.0⁢6) ×10−3 ev, 2⁢𝜀Sn =(1.11 ±0.0⁢3) ×10−3 ev, 2⁢𝜀In =(1.05 ±0.0⁢3) ×10−3 ev, and 2⁢𝜀Al =(0.32 ±0.0⁢3) ×10−3 ev.},
